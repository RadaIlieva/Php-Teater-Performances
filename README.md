The program represents a Theater Productions System. Its main purpose is to provide information about upcoming theatrical performances, including details such as the name of the performance, venue, date, image, and a brief description of the production (additional information). To create the system, I used PHP using the Laravel framework and Backpack (a set of packages designed for Laravel).


COMPONENTS:
Teaterperformances Model
The Teaterperformances model represents the data structure for theatrical performances. It includes fields such as name, venue, date, image, and additional_info.

UserCrudController
The UserCrudController manages user-related operations, allowing the addition of users who serve as administrators in the system.

TeaterperformancesCrudController
The TeaterperformancesCrudController handles CRUD operations for theatrical performances, including adding, editing, and deleting records.

Design
The design of the public section is implemented using Blade templates, including index.blade.php, search_results.blade.php, etc.
